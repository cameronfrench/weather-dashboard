# Weather-Dashboard
## Description

In this project, I built a Weather Dashboard that incorporated a search function by City, to which then current weather of that city would display as well as a 5 Day Forecast. After making new searches, a search history would build out below the search from and when clicking a previously searched city, the weather for that city would display.
